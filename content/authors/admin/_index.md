I hold an MS. in Applied Economics from UW-Madison and I studied Industrial Engineering (6-year program equivalent to BS and MS in Europe and the US) from Universidad de Chile (UChile). Also, I have a postgraduate in Big Data (hadoop ecosystem, machine and deep learning, high performance computing and network models for big data) from Pontificia Universidad Cat√≥lica de Chile (PUC-Chile).

I have 7 years of working experience in data science consultancy, quant (Financial Engineer in risk management) and Senior Economist for the Chilean government.

I worked as a Project Manager and Data Scientist at Brain Food (data science consulting firm in Chile). Where I lead a team of data analyst (functionals) and developers (IT) in the development of data products. I lead the relationship with the clients. In particular, we developed a platform for tracing the social network activity of our client brand. We measured impact index, efficiency of the rival firms and sentiment analysis of the users. Also, I was involved in commercial spatial valuation in cities with the aim of estimating the future demand.

As Senior Economist and Data Scientist for the Chilean Government (Ministry of Economy) I estimated the productivity at industrial level in Chile. Other projects I worked in: measuring the efficiency of operations in the public health service in Chile; evaluating the education system at a country level; among other projects.

I worked as a Senior Financial Engineer in Risk Management (Quant, financial market). I was responsible of the risk metric VaR (parametric and non-parametric) for the trading portfolios (derivatives). I participated in the definition of the valuation methodology of derivatives.
